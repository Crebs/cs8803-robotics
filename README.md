===============

Code for GTOMSC cs8803 ai-robotics problems hosted on udacity. Solutions for the problem sets, quizzes, and the runaway robot.

Please just take them as reference. Don't submit my solution as yours, you'll learn nothing anyway.

For Runaway robot, I usde extended kalman filter for question 2-4. I am unable to work out Q5 ie the one with v high measurement noise with my EKF. Solutions are welcomed.

Files runaway_robot_q1_no_noise.py, runaway_q2_ekf_5state_variables.py, runaway_q3_ekf.py, runaway_q4_ekf.py are the working
solutions, the rest are all unsuccessful attempts in my learning process.
